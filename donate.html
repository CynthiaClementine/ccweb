        <h3>Do you want to donate money to me? That's pretty neat! Here's a few things you should know!</h3>
        <p id="main">
            1. the link to my kofi account is <a href="https://ko-fi.com/cynthiaclementine">here</a>.<br>
            <b>2. This donation will not benefit you in any way.</b><br>
            You giving me money will not cause me to work on projects faster, or prioritize projects you want completed over others.<br>
            I realize this kind of sounds like discouraging you from donating, and.. yes, kind of.. &nbsp;&nbsp; - my goal here is to make sure you understand the conditions of this whole exchange. <br>
            If you donate, I will most likely be very thankful, but I won't owe you anything. Again, you don't gain anything by donating to me.<br>
            <b>3. please donate, i like money</b><br>
            I need money to live. I am in no danger of starving, but having more money would be nice, and it would let me know that my development work is appreciated.<br>
            It would be pretty neat for the programs I make here to generate some value for me, but I don't want to intrude on people's experiences of them with ads or subscription models. so this is.. this.
