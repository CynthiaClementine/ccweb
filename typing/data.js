I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them - usually their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on - and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same.`,

How does the level of water in a barrel change as a function of the amount of liquid poured into it? We see change occurring in nearly everything we observe in the world and universe, and powerful modern instruments help us see more and more. In this section we introduce the ideas of average and instantaneous rates of change, and show that they are closely related to the slope of a curve at a point P on the curve. We give precise developments of these important concepts in the next chapter, but for now we use an informal approach so you will see how they lead naturally to the main idea of this chapter, the limit. The idea of a limit plays a foundational role throughout calculus.`,

Of course, me telling you this doesn't mean you'll be any good at detective work. But beyond using that to solve this particular mystery, you should keep it in mind for the future.`,

He showed it to his mother who told him that you absolutely couldn't have a green great dragon, and that it had to be a great green one instead. Tolkien was so disheartened that he never wrote another story for years. The reason for Tolkien's mistake, since you ask, is that adjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order: opinion, size, age, shape, colour, origin, material, purpose, noun. So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife. But if you mess with that word order in the slightest you'll sound like a maniac. It's an odd thing that every English speaker uses that list, but almost none of us could write it out. And as size comes before colour, green great dragons can't exist.`,

Man knows not why a cow, dog, or lion was not born with a brain on a par with ours; why such animals cannot add, subtract, or obtain from books and schooling, that paramount position which Man holds today.`,

A great prosperity came, as life conquered even the highest mountains. Mass extinctions came wave after wave, but empty niches always quickly refilled, to once again prosper, grow, and reproduce.

Thus a meat market may be decorated in light green and blue-green tones, so that the various meats will appear fresher and redder. Confectionery shows to advantage in light orange, pink, white, and accents of black, stimulating an appetite for sweets.

Three researchers from Purdue University, M. Cooper, D. Dimitrov, and P. R. Rau, studied sixty-three companies that changed their names in 1998 and 1999 to include some web orientation. Measuring the price change of the companies from five days prior to a name change (when word of the change began to leak out) to five days after the change was announced, they confirmed a remarkable effect. Companies that changed their names enjoyed an increase in price during that ten-day period that was 125 percent greater than that of their peers. This price increase occurred even when the company's core business had nothing whatsoever to do with the Net.`,

Routinization, unfortunately, tends to take place very rapidly. Freud was still alive when his quest for liberating the ego from its oppressors was turned into a staid ideology and a rigidly regulated profession. Marx was even less fortunate: his attempts to free consciousness from the tyranny of economic exploitation were soon turned into a system of repression that would have boggled the poor founder's mind. And as Dostoevsky among many others have observed, if Christ had returned to preach his message of liberation in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name.`,

Nevertheless, in both of their lives were wound up the fates of millions of others in the US and Mexican countryside. Not long after World War II, the stormy public debate over rural poverty and the human impact of agricultural change tapered off in each nation. As conservatives silenced dissenting voices by means of force or compromise, it would be concerns of productivity - not inequality - that dominated the next generation of rural policy making.`,

	text: `On my trip to Kien Giang Province, in the far south of Vietnam, I traveled to Kien Luong coastal district to see what is reputedly the most beautiful island in the Mekong Delta. To get to Hon Nghe Islet I took National Road 80 to Nga Ba Hon wharf and caught a boat. The cruise departed early in the afternoon and we seemed to get lost in a wonderland, a small Ha Long Bay in the south. The cruise glided past many islands. The famous mountainous Phu Tu Islet was to the north surrounded by many smaller islands. The little islands have weird shapes - a stone castle, a whale and there's the coconut tree covered Ba Lua Island. After two hours we arrived at Hon Nghe Islet and went ashore in a small wooden boat. The first thing I saw, halfway up Lau Chuong Mountain, was a 20-meter-high statue of the Sakyamuni Buddha. The limestone mountain has many stalactite caves. We decided to go to the old Lien Ton Co Tu Pagoda. We had to conquer hundreds of stone steps to get the sanctuary. On the way, we passed the statue of Sakyaminu Buddha and Chuong (Bell) giant rock which will made a "boong... boong" sound like a bell when I struck it with a small rock. Further up are beautifully carved Arahat statues. The pagoda is about 20 meters inside a stone cave. On the mountain walls are many statues of lion, tiger and dragons. Night time in the pagoda is really peaceful and still. It was a full moon, so the ocean that looked amazing. The pagoda was blanketed in mist. Sometimes, the monks struck the wooden bell while they prayed. The gongs of the bell resonated with the other sounds in the forest. Early in the morning, I got up to enjoy the dawn. It was a contrast to the stillness of the night; the islet was very busy with fishing boats, fishermen and traders. Hon Nghe Islet is 320 meters high and 380 hectares. Tourists can take a boat trip to a fish farm to buy fish and discover the lives of local fishermen. The islet is also home to many species of birds. Phat Co Don Cave can be accessed by a winding path. Inside, it is like a living room and there is a Buddha statue. Some other caves are also worth a visit.`,

Indeed, over the course of evolution, the host cell and its endosymbiont merged into a single organism, a eukaryotic cell with a mitochondrion.

In addition to raising funds for Saigon Children's Charity (SCC), the Cyclo Challenge Version 2.0 includes a digital campaign designed to introduce the work of Saigon Children's Charity to the community to encourage young people to participate in making positive change through working in their communities and volunteering. This year's race has new rules and designs that could surprise veterans to the event. The racing teams will be made up of representatives from the event's exclusive Platinum sponsor and event Partner, VNG, as well as seven Gold sponsors including VinaLiving of VinaCapital Group, Adidas, HSBC, Hoang Long Hoan Vu, Jardines, JLT, Schindler, MegaStar and Halliburton. These eight teams will face each other in a thrilling team vs. team time trials to find the best and the fastest among them. The three fastest teams will enter the final round. The event is free for spectators. Another exciting feature of Cyclo Challenge Version 2.0 is the online campaign which was launched on Thursday, three weeks before race day. Cyclo Challenge Version 2.0, SCC has partnered with Zing Me, Vietnam's largest social network, and launched a completely new version of the game Parking Challenge, one of the most popular online games on the Zing Me network. By introducing Cyclo Challenge Version 2.0 to the Zing Me audience, Saigon Children's Charity hopes to reach out and inspire young people to effect positive change for the community. Previous Cyclo Challenges attracted 2-3,000 people a year. With the increased promotion as well as the elimination of ticket fees, the organizer hopes many more will come and help raise the target of US$30,000 to support disadvantaged children in the southern provinces of Vietnam. Since 2001 Saigon Children's Charity's annual Saigon Cyclo Challenge has attracted thousands of participants and over US$500,000 to help educate children in poverty and those who are disabled or vulnerable by building schools and providing scholarships and vocational training, enabling these children to gain a good education and equip themselves with the skills necessary to work their way out of poverty.`,

While early spies were often recruited solely because of their facility with a language, by the opening salvos of World War II, most intelligence agencies had their own schools to train agents in the language(s) of the enemy. And linguistic complexities made it difficult for some nations to be spied upon, as with the Japanese and Chinese. During the Cold War, both the CIA and the KGB even established institutes to study linguistics seeking to overcome such challenges.`,

Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field."

Renan referred to this imagining in his suavely back-handed way when he wrote that "Or l'essence d'une nation est que tons les individus aient beaucoup de choses en commun, et aussi que tous aient oublie bien des choses." With a certain ferocity Gellner makes a comparable point when he rules that 'Nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist.' The drawback to this formulation, however, is that Gellner is so anxious to show that nationalism masquerades under false pretences that he assimilates 'invention' to 'fabrication' and 'falsity', rather than to 'imagining' and 'creation'.`,

The Sumerian war-cart was a four-wheeled device composed of a woven basket mounted on wooden, solid wheels; it was manned by a crew of two carrying battle-axes and lances and pulled by a yoke of four onagers (those Asiatic asses). Although shown on this and other stele, there is considerable debate as to whether the war-carts were actually used in combat, or served more as a "battle taxi," carting the commander around to strategic locations where he could dismount and lead his troops personally in the melee. Whatever the function, the Sumerian war-cart was the genesis for the later horse-drawn war chariot.`,

Yes, it is somewhat vexing to thread through the stacks of a library, only to discover an absence rather than the sought-after volume, but once the ire subsides, doesn't one feel a sense of community?

To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.`,

At the opening of WW1, Germany had 28 U-boats in service; in the first ten weeks, these sank five British cruisers. So effective were the U-boats that the Treaty of Versailles forbade the construction of German submarines. But, the U-boat fleet was rebuilt, and by the end of WW2 the boats had sunk some 2779 ships (confirmed) totaling 14.1 million tons - roughly 70% of Allied losses in all theaters. In 1955 West Germany was allowed to have a navy again ... and promptly started building U-boats, the latest being the non-nuclear U-35, commissioned in March 2015.`,

By the time of its suspension, over 1500 "rocket scientists" had been recruited, blackmailed, or lured to work in and for the United States. As much as American progress, the purpose of the operation was to deny these folk to the Soviet Union, which had its own "Operation Osoaviakhim" doing the same thing. Among the more notable brought to America: Wernher von Braun, Kurt Debus, Hubertus Strughold, and Arthur Rudolph.`,

Based on the hoary old traditions of Platonic philosophy, these debates were judged based on the debaters' citation of "accepted" written works and the usual rhetorical skills of spokesmen. Disputations between Catholic and Jewish theologians (such as that in Paris in 1240) were quite polite; those between Protestants and Catholics (for instance, Regensburg in 1541) somewhat less so. Meanwhile, to the East the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great was hosting disputations between Muslim, Hindu, Jain, Zoroastrian, and Catholic Jesuit holy men as a show of his religious tolerance.`,

In the beginning, religious oratory carried only as far as a prophet's voice, but the mass media age gave it evangelical wings on radio (Billy Sunday, for example) and television (Billy Graham).`,

Then, a few pilots started taking shots at enemy pilots with pistols. Before anyone knew it, planes were equipped with machine guns (after Fokker solved that problem of shooting through a spinning propeller), and dogfighting began. Adventurous pilots invented maneuvers - such as the Immelmann and Low Yo-Yo - to give themselves an advantage in battle. Victory in a dogfight - unlike knightly jousts, it's more of a composite of fear and flames - quickly became a matter of technology and technique.`,

It was the world's first true "superpower," its tentacles reaching into every corner of society, culture, finance, and politics around the globe. The celebration, in accordance with Victoria's wishes, was reserved - and moral - consisting of a procession and thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. As Victoria's Diamond Jubilee approached, Victoria surpassed George III as the longest-reigning monarch in English or Scottish (or most anywhere else) history. Again, she insisted that the Jubilee be a festival of the Empire rather than her rule. In early January 1901, the queen regnant Victoria was feeling "weak and unwell"; she died quietly on 22 January, as dignified and reserved in death as in life.`,

More often idealized than practiced, Charlemagne's chevalerie ("horse soldiery") believed chivalry to include a code of conduct that elevated loyalty, honor, forbearance, hardihood and largess above all other knightly qualities (like trampling the godless).

The leaders of the new United States Congress quickly noted these and other flaws; they soon convened a secret convention meeting in Philadelphia in 1787 to revise the Articles. Instead, after much pontificating and argument, the conventioneers drafted a new Constitution entire, one adopted by the states in 1789, giving the United States' government its present shape - more or less. That same year Washington was elected the first president. In 1791 a Bill of Rights was added; since then 17 more amendments have been added and another six proposed to get it right.`,

The consuls were elected annually by the "centuriate assembly" - the Roman army. To ensure unity of command in times of great danger a "dictator" could be appointed from the consuls who had complete power. The second power bloc in the Roman government was the Senate. The Senate was composed of approximately 300 "virtuous" men drawn from the leading families. According to theory the Senate was strictly an advisory body, but in fact it held enormous political clout (given that members were all filthy rich), and its "advice" was almost always followed. The Roman Republic became the model, for better and worse, for most republics that followed.`,

This whole thing's kind of like a blind date - I mean here we are in your brand-new Corvette, running along the superinformation highway. Put your big muscular arm around me and whisper sweet nothings in my ear, and I promise you'll do whatever your little heart desires. BUT, only if you make the right moves. Just imagine watching me get propositioned by my sleazeball boss. BUT, if you make the wrong moves, you could turn me into a nun. Imagine that. Me? A nun? HA! I don't think so. But it's really all up to you. God knows what you'll do with that hot little mouse of yours. Point is: life's a game, and this game is full of life. You do right by me, and I guarantee I'll do right by you. But please please don't turn me into a nun. I'm not that kind of girl. I've got a reputation. Around town I'm known as microwave Jane because they say I heat up faster than any micro. And when the fire chief visited, he wrote up a new code, and made me wear a smoke alarm between my thighs. And then the Coast Guard, he said that I was creating tsunamis in my waterbed. And then the Pope visited, said I was the only person on earth that had been on my knees more times than he had. Now the president's filed a restraining order claiming I have a romantic interest in the Washington Monument. Oh, you men can be so vicious. Look at me! Just look at me! Do I look like that type of girl? Well if you think I'm that type of girl, you've got another thing coming, mister. 'Cause I don't do one-night stands, I don't date musicians, and I don't roll over just because you bought in this game. Fair warning - I'll be resisting your every move and enjoying your every mistake. I trust it won't be the first time you made mistakes with the opposite sex. Now listen up, the rules of the game are real simple. You see, I meet this guy in the parking lot. Now you are supposed to identify with this guy. I mean you, in your own perverse simple-minded way, are supposed to be him. Got it? Now if you make the right moves, I end up with this schlep, that is, I end up with you. But if you get real lucky, you end up saving me from the bad guy. You become my hero. And as a hero's reward, guess what? Are you game?

A long train of concubines, and a rapid succession of wives, among whom was a vestal virgin, ravished by force from her sacred asylum, were insufficient to satisfy the impotence of his passions. The master of the Roman world affected to copy the manners and dress of the female sex, preferring the distaff to the sceptre, and dishonored the principal dignities of the empire by distributing them among his numerous lovers; one of whom was publicly invested with the title and authority of the emperor's, or, as he more properly styled himself, the empress's husband. It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice.

This was only in part a personal trait, for upper-class Romans were educated to compete with one another and to excel. However, he combined an overriding concern for his personal interests with a deep-seated patriotism, based on a nostalgia of Rome's antique virtues. In his capacity as princeps, selfishness and selflessness coexisted in his mind. While fighting for dominance, he paid little attention to legality or to the normal civilities of political life. He was devious, untrustworthy, and bloodthirsty. But once he had established his authority, he governed efficiently and justly, generally allowed freedom of speech, and promoted the rule of law. He was immensely hardworking and tried as hard as any democratic parliamentarian to treat his senatorial colleagues with respect and sensitivity. He suffered from no delusions of grandeur.`,

But then, one winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at the gift and turned the old woman away. But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The prince tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that there was no love in his heart. And as punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose, which would bloom until his 21st year. If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time. As the years passed, he fell into despair and lost all hope. For who could ever learn to love a beast?`,

The man thinks about it and then asks if he will be allowed to come in later on. "It is possible," says the gatekeeper, "but not now." At the moment the gate to the law stands open, as always, and the gatekeeper walks to the side, so the man bends over in order to see through the gate into the inside. When the gatekeeper notices that, he laughs and says: "If it tempts you so much, try it in spite of my prohibition. But take note: I am powerful. And I am only the most lowly gatekeeper. But from room to room stand gatekeepers, each more powerful than the other. I can't endure even one glimpse of the third." The man from the country has not expected such difficulties: the law should always be accessible for everyone, he thinks, but as he now looks more closely at the gatekeeper in his fur coat, at his large pointed nose and his long, thin, black Tartar's beard, he decides that it would be better to wait until he gets permission to go inside. The gatekeeper gives him a stool and allows him to sit down at the side in front of the gate. There he sits for days and years. He makes many attempts to be let in, and he wears the gatekeeper out with his requests. The gatekeeper often interrogates him briefly, questioning him about his homeland and many other things, but they are indifferent questions, the kind great men put, and at the end he always tells him once more that he cannot let him inside yet. The man, who has equipped himself with many things for his journey, spends everything, no matter how valuable, to win over the gatekeeper. The latter takes it all but, as he does so, says, "I am taking this only so that you do not think you have failed to do anything." During the many years the man observes the gatekeeper almost continuously. He forgets the other gatekeepers, and this one seems to him the only obstacle for entry into the law. He curses the unlucky circumstance, in the first years thoughtlessly and out loud, later, as he grows old, he still mumbles to himself. He becomes childish and, since in the long years studying the gatekeeper he has come to know the fleas in his fur collar, he even asks the fleas to help him persuade the gatekeeper. Finally his eyesight grows weak, and he does not know whether things are really darker around him or whether his eyes are merely deceiving him. But he recognizes now in the darkness an illumination which breaks inextinguishably out of the gateway to the law. Now he no longer has much time to live. Before his death he gathers in his head all his experiences of the entire time up into one question which he has not yet put to the gatekeeper. He waves to him, since he can no longer lift up his stiffening body.`,

	text: `The sport of mountain biking is one of the best active sports you can do for a number of fitness reasons and depending on what style of mountain biking you partake in, it can be also a great deal of fun as well as keeping you fit at the same time. People are usually unaware of how may muscles you use when riding a mountain bike, and how quickly you can burn calories off riding a bike as it can be an extremely good work out for the body. If you plan on riding cross-country along different styles of trails, riding a bike can be quite a task. So if you riding over a vast distance up and down hills, along slippery single trail it can be very exhausting on the legs and the lower back. So if you are just starting to ride bikes for the first time, please don't just jump on the bike a go for a 20 mile ride as it may do you more harm than good. One thing that is recommended is to do short rides to start with, maybe only a couple of miles which will take no time at all on a bike to get your fitness training up to scratch before hitting the bike ride. All of the major athletes of the sport will tell you that mountain bike training is vastly important and you should take part in mountain bike fitness training when ever the opportunity arises. Going on those short rides will benefit you hugely and will stop you from injuring yourself. Parts of your body that will benefit from training are your legs. Your legs will be the first part of your body in particular that will get tired very quickly. Building up your leg muscles either at the gym or one the bike will help improve your personal and bike fitness quickly. The more you train the better your pace and your stamina will improve. Once these two have improved you will be able to go on longer and better rides than will enhance your fitness. One of the major benefits of riding a mountain bike on a regular basis is that in order to ride your bike you use some of largest muscles in the body which in turn will burn off fat quickly. This will of course help you to lose weight and the more you ride you bike the more weight you will lose. When you ride your bike on flat ground at a slower speed you are still burning a great amount of calories due to the fact that you will be able to continue that pedaling motion for a longer period of time. This is also perfect for people who don't have the stamina for a highly intensive ride at different speeds and climbs etc. Low intensity work outs also don't give you all the extra muscle either so the weight will stay off. In summary using a mountain bike to keep yourself fit what ever your style of riding is a great way to keep fit, and training will also keep you one step ahead of your game. Don't forgot even if you don't ride cross-country and are just as happy down the local skate park you are still having fun on your bike and at the end of the day that's all that matters. We hope you have found this Mountain biking fitness article useful. There are many different types and styles of riding than you may have first thought. So when choosing a bike make sure you choose the bike that's right for you.`,

	text: `You might be one of those people that perform very well when it comes to sports. If you are and you are in high school, you might have the idea that your ability at a given sport could end up putting you in line for a sports scholarship that will either entirely pay for college, or at least partially pay for your higher education. However, there is more to getting a scholarship than just being good at sports. One thing you have to understand is that with sports scholarship there are a few ways to get them. For some, especially in the more high profile sports like football and basketball, you have a good chance at being recruited; however, not all scholarships that are sports related come from athletes being recruited. In many cases, if you are looking for a sports scholarship, for whatever sport you happen to play, you might just have to ask. With so many high school athletes, it is conceivable that your talents at a given sport are heads and shoulders above most people; but there is still the possibility you will be overlooked. There are too many athletes and only a small number of coaches and recruits, comparatively speaking. Sometimes you will have to contact a coach yourself, offer them up your statistics, not only on the field of play but your grades as well. In essences, you are going to have to recruit them, much like a college coach might recruit a person of superior talent. Consider this, in most scholarship situations, a person has to ask for one rather than them being solicited for a scholarship. In fact, the way scholarships are offered to potential students are less normal and less common than the traditional way of getting a scholarship, which is to request one. Another to remember is that you will have to be persistent as well. You will have to be aware that you might hear no a lot. However, if you have the skills and you have the talent, and of course you'll need the grades as well, you will eventually find a sports scholarship that fits your needs. The fact is that there are plenty of sports scholarship to go around. Some might be full scholarships, others might be partial scholarships, and it is wise to not get too far ahead of yourself and only look for full scholarships as the only option. While they do exist, they are not easy to get and when it comes to paying for college these days, any help paying for it is welcome, or at least it should be.`,
