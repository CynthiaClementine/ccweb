		`Some have traveled but a short distance. Some have gone further. Others still have crossed the entire world.`,
		`And when you get your wish, it's wonderful. But if you are the type of person to end up here, then you're also the type of person who will not be happy forever.`
		`There must come a point at which the novelty wears off. At which you yearn for something yet greater. And where will you be then? You break down my door with cries for more.`, 
		`With great fiery claws that no only hunger.`,
		`Your journey does not end when you walk out of here unless you accept that you do not need what you wish for.`,
		`>wow.`,
