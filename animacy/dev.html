            Alright. I'm setting up this page to detail my plans for further development, and as a general timeline of sorts.<br>
            There are currently a few outstanding issues that need fixing. However, I've been working on this for almost 9 months now, so I'm going to take a 2 week break.<br>
            After that, here are the issues I plan to fix:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-undo/redo breaks on intersecting lines<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-exporting save files works fine. However, importing save files produces issues.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the cursor move tool needs to work, and fills need to be easier to manupulate<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-there should be an actual menu for modifying tool properties<br>
            <br>
            I have ideas for more features in the future, but I think these problems should be fixed before I get to those.<br>
            oh yeah one last thing if you want to contact me you can do it at cyclementine0@gmail.com I'll probably respond at some point but it may not be fast
